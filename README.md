# 💻 Software-Engineering-Portfolio

A learning and practice repository that tracks my growth as a **software engineer**.

This repository focuses on building strong **software engineering fundamentals** such as clean code, backend development, deployments, and reliable system design.  
It is not limited to one application , instead, it shows how my engineering skills improve across different projects and learning phases.

The goal is to develop **real-world software engineering skills** that scale beyond a single app.

## 📌 Overview

Good software is not just about writing code , it is about writing **clean, reliable, and maintainable systems**.

This repository focuses on:
- Writing clean and readable code
- Building and structuring backend systems
- Designing and consuming APIs
- Using version control properly
- Deploying and maintaining applications
- Improving code quality over time

All work is documented to clearly show **learning progress and growth**.
